# hello-world
First time interacting with GitHub!

My name is Clay Taylor and I am 25 years-old and I live in Oklahoma City. I am getting married on March 28, 2020 to my best friend in the whole world, McKaela.

I went to a coding bootcamp in Boulder, Colorado in 2016, but struggled to learn the way they taught there. I am very methodical and detailed in learning, but my education was a bit rushed and glazed over. That is okay though. I am determined to learn and apply what I know to further myself and my budding development career. I will be a Web Developer and I will be successful.

I am starting fresh with a clean slate on what I am learning and what I want to do. I currently have a dozen projects in mind that I want to build out and my GitHub should reflect them. :)

If you've read this far, thanks for your time and I hope to chat / meet you soon!


Best,

Clay Taylor
